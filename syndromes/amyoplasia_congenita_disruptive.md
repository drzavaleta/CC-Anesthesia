# Amyoplasia Congenita Disruptive Syndrome

## General

- Part of Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita
- Multiple joint contractures
- Two forms:
    - Neuropathic: reduced number of anterior horn cells; demyelinated motor roots; fewer axons in peripheral nerve roots.
    - Myopathic: contractors due to lack of intrauterine movement. 

## Airway

- Micrognathia
- Cleft palate

## Respiratory

- Hypoplastic lungs
- Diaphragmatic hernia
- Hydrothorax

## Gastrointestinal

- Gastroschisis
- Pyloric stenosis

## Musculoskeletal

- Scoliosis
- Contractures
- Joint deformities

## Considerations

- Difficult airway
- Positioning nightmare
- Difficult intravenous access possible
- No relationship between arthrogryposis syndromes and MH
