# Palmer Kidney Transplant

## PreOp

### Setup

- Alaris Pump with NS carrier and 2 channels 
    - Channel 1 will be anti-rejection med
    - Channel 2 will be ***phenylephrine*** gtt (start at 0.1-0.2 mcg/kg/min)
- Lower body bear hugger
- Art line, central line, PIV, Fluid warmer
- HME

### Antibiotic

- ***Ancef*** prior to incision (***Clindamycin*** if ***Ancef*** contraindicated)

### Solu-Medrol IV

- Dose and timing dependent on surgeon and whether dose was given as a premed for ***Thymoglobulin***

## Intraop

- Plan for A-line on non-fistula arm
- Central line to monitor CVP
- 2 PIV both NS (Albumin is OK)
- Tap block may be of benefit (consider ***Exparel***)

### Prior to Incision

- Immunosuppressant (Surgeon ordered)
  - Start in central line once available (but may give via PIV)
  - ***Simulect*** or ***Thymoglobulin***:
    - ***Simulect***
      - Infuse over 30 minutes
      - No premed required
      - Preferred route is via central line, but may give via PIV
    - ***Thymoglobulin***
      - Infuse over 6 hours
      - Must premedicate: ***Tylenol***, ***benadryl***, steroid (usually ***Solu-Medrol***)

### Arterial Anastomosis

- ***Solu-Medrol***
  - May be requested to be given now (unless given preoperatively)
  - Dr. Palmer requests 10mg/kg
  
- ***Mannitol***
  - Will be requested by surgeon after arterial anastomosis
  - Dose: 0.5 - 1 gm/kg
  - Max dose: 50 gm

- ***Lasix IV***
  - Will be requested by surgeon (usually right after ***mannitol***)
  - Dr. Palmer will request dose at 20mg x preop creatinine

- ***Papaverine***
  - Surgeon may inject intra-arterial
  - Prepare for pressure to drop
  - May need to bolus with volume
  - May need to start ***phenylephrine*** at 0.1 mcg/kg/min
  - May need to give boluses of ***phenylephrine*** as well

### Blood Pressure Management

- Systolic goal: >120mmHg (or 95% of normal for age)
- Preferred to use volume before a pressor
- If pressor needed, use ***phenylephrine*** infusion (avoid ***dopamine***)
- If pressure too high, use ***nicardipine*** (0.5mcg/kg/min up to 5)
- Goal CVP: 8-12mmHg
- On clamp removal-expect BP drop. So plan ahead with fluid load up front 30-60ml/kg and possible colloid
- Plan presser gtt to start around anastomosis to keep means at goal 100-120% of baseline SBP

## Post Op
- Go straight to ICU
- They will have urine replaced cc/cc with crystalloid so you can be liberal with fluids
-  ***Heparin***
   -  Surgeon may request it be started in OR (10 units/kg/hr)

## Blood Product Administration

- 10-20kg: will receive one unit of blood
- Over 20kg: preference is to try an avoid transfusion
