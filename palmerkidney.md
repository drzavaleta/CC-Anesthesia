# Palmer Kidney Transplant


## PreOp

### Setup

- Alaris Pump with NS carrier and 2 channels 
    - One channel will be anti-rejection med
    - Second channel will be Phenylephrine gtt (start at 0.1-0.2 mcg/kg/min to keep systolic at goal number - bumps of Phenylephrine are OK too).
- Lower body bear hugger
- Art line, central line, PIV, Fluid warmer
- HME

### Antibiotic

- Ancef prior to incision (Clindamycin if Ancef contraindicated)

### Solu-Medrol IV

- Will be requested by surgeon (usually at artery anastomosis)
- Dose and timing dependent on surgeon and whether dose was given as a premed for Thymoglobulin
- Dr. Palmer requests 10mg/kg

## Intraop

- Plan for A-line on non-fistula arm
- Central line to monitor CVP
- 2 PIV both NS (Albumin is OK)
- Tap block may be of benefit (consider Exparel)

### Immunosuppressant (Surgeon ordered)

- Simulect or Thymoglobulin started after central line placement
- Simulect
  - infuse over 30 minutes
  - no premed required
  - preferred route is via central line (may give via PIV)
- Thymoglobulin
  - infuse over 6 hours
  - must premedicate: Tylenol, benadryl, steroid (usually Solu-Medrol

### Mannitol

- Will be requested by surgeon (usually at venous anastomosis)
- Dose: 0.5 - 1 gm/kg
- Max dose: 50 gm
- Dose is surgeon dependent

### Lasix IV

- Will be requested by surgeon (usually at ureter anastomosis)
- Dr. Palmer will usually order 20mg x preop creatinine

## Post Op
- Go straight to ICU.
- They will have urine replaced cc/cc with crystalloid so you can be liberal with fluids

## Blood Pressure Management

- Systolic goal: >120mmHg (or 95% of normal for age)
- Preferred to use volume (not a pressor)
- If pressor needed, use phenylephrine infusion (avoid dopamine)
- Goal CVP: 8-12mmHg
  - On clamp removal-expect BP dropâ€¦so plan ahead with fluid load up front 30-60ml/kg and possible colloid
Plan presser gtt to start around anastomosis to keep means at goal 100-120% of baseline SBP

## Blood Product Administration

- 10-20kg: will receive one unit of blook
- Over 20kg: preference is to try an avoid transfusion
