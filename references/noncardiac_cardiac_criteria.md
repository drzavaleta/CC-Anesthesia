# Criteria: Non-Cardiac vs Cardiac

(v2022)

## Pathophysiology that will routinely NOT require cardiac anesthesia:

- Unrepaired simple congenital heart disease (ASD, VSD, PDA, etc.) without hemodynamic compromise/evidence of heart failure
- Patients with repaired congenital heart disease without significant residual lesions and preserved ventricular function (EF > 35%)
- Patients with stable Kawasaki disease without clinically significant aneurysms and no evidence of ischemia
- Patients with pacemakers or AICDs
- Patients with the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy or compromised ventricular function whose EF is greater than 35%
- Patients with Williams syndrome with no significant known or residual aortic or pulmonary stenosis and no known coronary artery disease/abnormalities
- Mild aortic or mitral stenosis including artificial valves
- Heart transplant recipients with preserved ventricular function
- Patients with free pulmonary insufficiency in the setting of preserved (normal) RV function
- Patients with pulmonary hypertension < 2/3 systemic


## Pathophysiology that will routinely REQUIRE cardiac anesthesia care:

- Children with non-palliated single ventricle physiology, including ductal dependent lesions
- Children with complex, unrepaired congenital heart disease (TGA, TOF, DORV)
- Patients with staged, palliated single ventricle physiology (Glenn, Fontan)
- Patients with pulmonary hypertension that is >2/3 systemic (excluding normal neonatal physiology)
- Patients the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy or compromised ventricular function whose EF is less than 35%
- Moderate to severe mitral valve stenosis
- Moderate to severe left sided obstructive lesions including valvar, subvalvar, and supravalvar aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta
- Patients cared for in the CICU, CVOR or Cath Labs

## Consultation with a cardiac anesthesiologist for appropriate stratification should occur in the following settings:

- Patients with a history of heart failure requiring ongoing medical management, or symptoms of heart failure in the face of an elevated BNP > 500
- Patients with compromised ejection fraction (35-45%) undergoing surgery for > 4 hours and/or in which significant fluid shifts are anticipated
- Any patient who does not clearly fit into one of the above categories
